# spaCy Fundamentals
 
 **NLP using Spacy**

*spaCy* is an open source *Natuaral Language Processing Library* for python. It is efficient, convenient, user-friendly and requires little code to accomplish the same task for which traditional NLP packages like nltk take comparitively more code and more time.

Spacy has put together an interactive course for beginners to perform nlp tasks using spacy. It goes right from *word tokenization* to finding out *document similarity* and has much more in it. The aim of the python notebook Spacy_Fundamentals is to document the code from this course together (and reproduce it with their results) in one book and explore the functionality of spaCy language.

The complete course put together by *Ines Montani* (https://github.com/ines), cofounder of spacy can be found here: https://course.spacy.io/chapter1

This notebook contains a brief synopsis of all the concepts covered in the first three chapters of this interactive course.
